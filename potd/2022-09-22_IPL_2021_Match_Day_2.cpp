Due to the rise of covid-19 cases in India, this year BCCI decided to organize knock-out matches in IPL rather than a league.
Today is matchday 2 and it is between the most loved team Chennai Super Kings and the most underrated team - Punjab Kings.
Stephen Fleming, the head coach of CSK, analyzing the batting stats of Punjab.
He has stats of runs scored by all N players in the previous season and he wants to find the maximum score for 
each and every contiguous sub-list of size K to strategize for the game.

Example 1:
Input:
N = 9, K = 3
arr[] = 1 2 3 1 4 5 2 3 6
Output: 
3 3 4 5 5 5 6 
Explanation: 
1st contiguous subarray = {1 2 3} Max = 3
2nd contiguous subarray = {2 3 1} Max = 3
3rd contiguous subarray = {3 1 4} Max = 4
4th contiguous subarray = {1 4 5} Max = 5
5th contiguous subarray = {4 5 2} Max = 5
6th contiguous subarray = {5 2 3} Max = 5
7th contiguous subarray = {2 3 6} Max = 6
