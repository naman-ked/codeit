/*
You start with an array A of size N. Initially all elements of the array A are zero. 
You will be given K positive integers. Let j be one of these integers, you have to add 1 to all A[i], where i ≥ j.
Your task is to print the array A after all these K updates are done.
Note: 1-based indexing is followed for updates.

Example 1:
Input:
N = 3, K = 4
1 1 2 3
Output:
2 3 4
Explanation: Initially the array is {0, 0, 0}. After the first 1, it becomes {1, 1, 1}. After the second 1 it becomes {2, 2, 2}. After 2,  it becomes {2, 3, 3} and  After 3 it becomes, {2, 3, 4}.
